____________________________________________________________________________________________
### Problem Statement

State population sizes play a crucial role in shaping economies, but their impact on overall socioeconomic well-being isn't straightforward. This project digs into how factors like education levels, age, race and income vary between population extremes to facilitate research and policy-making.
